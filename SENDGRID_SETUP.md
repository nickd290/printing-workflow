# SendGrid Email Setup Guide

## Overview
Your system is now configured to send professional emails via SendGrid using:
- **From Email:** nick@jdgraphic.com
- **Display Name:** IDP Production
- **Beautiful HTML templates** for all email notifications

---

## Step 1: Get Your SendGrid API Key

### 1.1 Create a SendGrid Account
If you don't have one already:
1. Go to https://sendgrid.com
2. Sign up for a free account (or use your existing account)
3. Free tier includes 100 emails/day forever

### 1.2 Create an API Key
1. Log in to SendGrid
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API Keys** (https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys)
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Name it: `IDP Production API Key`
5. Choose **Full Access** (recommended) or **Restricted Access** with at least:
   - Mail Send: **Full Access**
6. Click **Create & View**
7. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the API key immediately (you won't be able to see it again!)

---

## Step 2: Configure the Sender Email

### 2.1 Verify Your Domain (Recommended)
For production use, verify `jdgraphic.com`:

1. In SendGrid, go to **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Verify a Single Sender** (easier) OR **Authenticate Your Domain** (better for production)

#### Option A: Single Sender Verification (Easiest)
1. Click **Verify a Single Sender**
2. Fill in:
   - **From Name:** IDP Production
   - **From Email Address:** nick@jdgraphic.com
   - **Reply To:** nick@jdgraphic.com (or support email)
   - Company details
3. Click **Create**
4. Check your email (nick@jdgraphic.com) and click the verification link

#### Option B: Domain Authentication (Better for Production)
1. Click **Authenticate Your Domain**
2. Choose your DNS host (where jdgraphic.com is registered)
3. Follow the instructions to add DNS records (CNAME records)
4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually < 1 hour)

## Step 3: Add API Key to Your Application

### 3.1 Update .env File
Edit `/Users/nicholasdeblasio/printing-workflow/.env`:

```bash
# Replace the empty SENDGRID_API_KEY with your actual key:
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your-actual-api-key-here"
EMAIL_FROM="nick@jdgraphic.com"
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="IDP Production"
# ALL EMAILS will go to this address (perfect for testing!)
EMAIL_REDIRECT_TO="nick@starterboxstudios.com"
```

**Email Redirect Feature (Already Configured!):**
- All emails will be sent to `nick@starterboxstudios.com`
- Subject line will show original recipient: `[For: customer@example.com] Invoice Ready`
- Email body will have a yellow banner showing the original recipient
- Perfect for testing without spamming real customers!
- To disable: remove or leave `EMAIL_REDIRECT_TO` empty

### 3.2 Restart Your API Server
Since the API is running, you'll need to restart it to pick up the new environment variable:

1. Stop the current API server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
2. Restart it:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nicholasdeblasio/printing-workflow/apps/api
   npx pnpm dev
   ```

## Step 4: Test Email Sending

### 4.1 Create a Test Job
1. Go to http://localhost:5174/jobs
2. Click **+ New Job**
3. Fill in the form and submit
4. The system will automatically send a "Job Created" email

### 4.2 Check Email Delivery
- **If SendGrid is configured:** Check the recipient's inbox
- **If not configured yet:** Emails will be logged to the API console with full details

### 4.3 Monitor in SendGrid Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
2. View all sent emails, delivery status, opens, and clicks
