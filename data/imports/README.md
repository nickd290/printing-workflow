## üöÄ How to Import

1. **Drop your CSV files** into the appropriate folders above

2. **Run the import script**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nicholasdeblasio/printing-workflow
   npm run import:csv
   ```

3. **Check the output** - The script will tell you:
   - How many records were imported
   - Any errors or skipped records
   - Which files were processed

## üìã Import Order

The script automatically imports in the correct order:
1. Companies (needed first for relationships)
2. Users (needs companies)
3. Contacts (needs companies)
4. Jobs (needs companies)
5. Purchase Orders (needs jobs)
6. Invoices (needs jobs)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Backup first**: The import will ADD to existing data (not replace)
- **CSV format**: Use UTF-8 encoding
- **Dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-01-15)
- **Decimals**: Use standard decimal notation (e.g., 123.45)
- **Required fields**: Make sure all required columns have values
- **Relationships**: Companies must exist before importing jobs/users/contacts

## üîÑ Fresh Start (Replace All Data)

If you want to completely replace the existing data:

```bash
# 1. Clear the database
cd /Users/nicholasdeblasio/printing-workflow/packages/db
DATABASE_URL="file:/Users/nicholasdeblasio/printing-workflow/packages/db/prisma/dev.db" npx prisma db push --force-reset

# 2. Run the import
cd /Users/nicholasdeblasio/printing-workflow
npm run import:csv
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"Company not found" error**
- Make sure you've imported companies first
- Check that company names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**"Invalid status" error**
- Status must be one of: PENDING, IN_PRODUCTION, READY_FOR_PROOF, PROOF_APPROVED, COMPLETED

**"Duplicate email" error**
- Each user email must be unique
- Check for duplicate emails in your CSV

**File encoding issues**
- Save your CSV as UTF-8 encoding
- Avoid special characters that might cause encoding issues
