## üöÄ Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Backend First
1. Use the curl commands above to test all endpoints
2. Verify data is being saved correctly
3. Then build frontend with confidence

### Option 2: Build Frontend Now
1. Create comprehensive job detail page
2. Wire up all the API calls
3. Test end-to-end workflow

### Option 3: Incremental Approach
1. Build one tab at a time
2. Test each tab as you go
3. Gradually complete the full interface
